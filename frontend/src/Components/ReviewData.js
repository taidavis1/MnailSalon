Needed a mani/pedi and told them my feet hurt. They gave me a a hot stone massage with my pedicure with a very flavorful adult beverage and I was good as new. Best part‚Ä¶THEY‚ÄôRE RIGHT NEXT TO CENTRAL MARKET at Coit and George Bush Hwy. Where have you been all my life!!! Thank you so much. Very friendly people.",

I have had my nails done by a few different techs at M Spa and they always do a good job. They give great attention to detail, they are very clean, and even the music in the salon is wonderful! I always enjoy my time here.",
